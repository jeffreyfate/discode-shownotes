### Quality Code
- #### Tip
    Setup and memorize aliases for your most used Git commands. I use [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) for my terminal which makes it easy to create aliases. My most used are `gst` (git status), `gcmsg` (git commit w/ message), and `gsta` (git stash). Apple is [adopting zsh as the default shell in macOS Catalina](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208050).
- #### Topic
  - Git (version control)
    - Contains the full repository and history of all contents, on each computer
    - Allows for easy branching and merging
    - A [typical Git workflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
        - `master` branch that represents the current source of truth for the project
        - `hotfix` branches that are created from `master` to bug fix master
            - Later merged to lower branches as well
        - `release` branches when development is done with a feature and/or a set of changes
            - Bug fixes only on that branch (which are then merged to lower branches)
        - `develop` is branched from master originally and contains new changes not ready for release
        - `feature` branches are created from `develop` and merged to develop as each feature is completed
        - The diagram in the link above does a great job of describing this flow
    - Lots of tools that help you manage git repositories
        - Avoid coding by coincidence though and learn the commands and the options you need most often
    - More fun features
        - [git hooks](https://githooks.com/)
            - Create scripts that run at different stages of git workflow
            - Most used is likely `pre-commit`, which allows for enforcing a style of commit messages to make the commit history consistent and readable
            - Allows you to automate tasks connected with your git workflow
