### Intro
- #### Tease
    Coming up on Discode, now that we have the feature (project), design (architecture), and version control, we can start thinking about the nuts and bolts, or the tools we're going to use to get the job done.

- #### Personal
    - Practicing breaking down a feature is critical
    - Having discourse with people is very important
    - Refactoring takes a ton of effort and time
### Quality Code
- #### Tip
    Try your best to choose the best tool for the job and not to force a tool to do something it wasn't made to do.
- #### Topic
  - Choosing Tools
    - What are we talking about?
        - Languages
        - Frameworks
        - Deployment targets
        - Data storage
        - Messaging
        - Build and CI
    - Examples (I find it best to learn something with examples)
        - Java vs Scala vs Groovy vs Kotlin (JVM languages only)
        - Spring vs cobbling together your own tools
        - Cloud patterns
            - AWS
            - Serverless
        - Data
            - Relational
            - File
            - Document / NoSQL
