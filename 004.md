### Intro
- #### Tease
    Test your code! I'm talking today about how to test and what to test when writing code.
- #### Music
    From artist Quincas Moreira
- #### Personal
    - Fun to write solid, tested code
    - Hard for other people to learn - don't force them
    - Keep it super simple
### Quality Code
- #### Tip
    Unsure what exactly you're building? Test only once you've figured it out and it works.
- #### Topic
  - Testing
    - Testing pyramid
        - E2E/System
        - Integrated
        - Integration/Contract
        - Component
        - Unit
    - TDD
        - Works for well defined changes
    - Test Coverage
        - Not a catch all, but good indicator if you tested what you meant to test
    - Dependency Injection
        - Only way to cover with unit tests
    - Mocking
        - If you have injected objects that are complicated, you need it
        - Try and inject only simple objects, like functions, because it makes testing easier
    - Mutation Testing
    - Property Based Testing
