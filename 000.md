### Quality Code
- #### Tip
    When chunking up work, try to create the smallest possible work items that still standalone to provide value
- #### Topic
  - Project or Feature Design
    - Test Validity
    - Start with something large then keep dividing chunks smaller and smaller
    - Find the highest priority items by using the 80/20 rule
      - What will provide the most value for the least work?
