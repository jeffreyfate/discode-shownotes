### Quality Code
- #### Tip
    The only way you can truely define what your system will need and look like is to get decision makers in the room and explain your architecture plan. It will definitely change, but at least it won't be (as) wrong.
- #### Topic
  - Design (Architecture)
    - The second step in quality code
    - Definitive answer? It depends. Ha!
    - Choose a style
        - Component-based
            - Vertical functionality that can be split into layers
            - Simple example: Login UI component that talks to a login controller, that talks to a login service, that interacts with the login data store.
            - Think microservices
            - Lots of separate deployables and concerns that need to work together
        - Monolithic / Client-server
            - Lumping these together because they are so closely related
            - Component, but where all the components mingle and meld together
            - Can make change difficult
            - Simple to get started
        - Event Driven / Serverless
            - Usually synonymous
            - Reacting to events
            - Everything lives on its own and subscribes to events that it cares about
            - Human interaction is asynchronous
    - Patterns
        - MVC
            - Controller manipulates the model and renders the view
            - View sends requests to controller and displays the model
        - DDD
            - All aspects of system have their place and are defined using ubiquitous language and strict boundaries
    - Everything has its positives and drawbacks. The win in this battle is knowing them so you can correctly choose which ones you want.
