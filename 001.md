### Quality Code
- #### Tip
    The only way you can truely define what your system will need and look like is to get decision makers in the room and explain your architecture plan. It will definitely change, but at least it won't be (as) wrong.
- #### Topic
  - Design (Architecture)
    - The second step in quality code
    - Choose a style
        - Component-based
        - Monolithic
        - Event Driven
        - Client Server
    - Patterns
        - MVC
        - DDD
    - Everything has its positives and drawbacks. The win in this battle is knowing them so you can correctly choose which ones you want.
